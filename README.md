# AI-ML Node.js Project

A Node.js-based project that uses machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze and classify user-provided product feedback as positive or negative.

## Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning libraries in Node.js to perform sentiment analysis on product feedback. By using pre-trained models or custom-trained models, the application identifies whether feedback is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Features

- Sentiment Analysis: Classify feedback as positive or negative.
- Scalable API: Set up with Node.js to handle sentiment analysis requests.
- Easy Deployment: Can be deployed on cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or any server supporting Node.js.

Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
Express: Web framework for building the API.
TensorFlow.js: For ML model integration (if applicable).
Sentiment Analysis Libraries: Such as sentiment or custom models for NLP.

## Installation
